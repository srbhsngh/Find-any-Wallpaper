					<p>Our story isn't really our story, because iLoveWALLPAPER ™ isn't about us.

					You know what I'am talking about. Cool Wallpapers are difficult to find. Think about it. The time you waste 
					finding the Wallpapers you need could be spent doing the things that matter, things that make you happy.</p>
